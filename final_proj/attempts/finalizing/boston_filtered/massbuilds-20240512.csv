Importantly, overall Gross Floor Area (“GFA”) will not increase and no significant alterations to the building exterior, envelope or site plan are proposed as part of this change of use. To enable the building for both office and life science/R&D uses, Oxford will be upgrading key building infrastructure and modernizing the MEP systems. While completing these upgrades, the developer will also be making required code updates and implementing other changes designed to bring the building in-line with Oxford’s current global standards for sustainability and resiliency. Additionally, the developer will be refreshing 745 Atlantic’s ground floor through a renovation of the lobby and the addition of 4,100 square feet of retail/restaurant space. The lobby renovation is intended to create a space that is more welcoming to the public and better integrated with the other ground-floor uses, similar to other lobby renovations Oxford has completed across its portfolio in Boston.
