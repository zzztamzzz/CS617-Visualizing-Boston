1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   The primary tasks include the addition of new data types (long and double) and support for a wide range
   of operators such as arithmetic, logical, and assignment operators.
   Additionally, complex control structures like conditional expressions, loops (for, do-while), and switch
   statements are to be developed. This phase also demands the implementation of break and continue
   functionalities within loop constructs and switch statements, which are crucial for proper flow control.
   Moreover, advanced features such as exception handling frameworks (try, catch, finally) and interface
   declarations are introduced, further aligning j-- with standard Java capabilities. Each construct requires detailed
   analysis and generation of bytecode that will be executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
   The assignment demands meticulous attention to the integration of these features, ensuring they are correctly
   analyzed for type safety and effectively translated into JVM code, paving the way for
   executing j-- programs that utilize these new features.
