1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

  The Java Parser is a critical tool for comprehending and processing
  Java Source Code. The goal of this project is to add functionality to the
  own JavaCC parser so that it is able to analyze Java Source Code and
  correctly construct the respective Abstract Syntax Trees and Token images,
  which makes it easier to work with and manipulate Java programs.
  Our task was to equip the parser with functionality so that it supported
  expressions, operators, conditional statements, and fundamental data types.
  The 'j--.jj' file focuses in the initial parsing stage, creating a
  structured representation of a Java program source code.
  This project serves as a valuable starting point for developers aiming to construct more
  complex Java-related tools and applications.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
